## System Requirements

The DataTank requires a server with

* Apache2 or Nginx
* mod rewrite enabled
* PHP 5.4 or higher
* Mcrypt installed and enabled
* Git
* Any database supported by [Laravel 4](http://laravel.com/docs/4.0/database)
* dbase PHP extension

If you're using aÂ <strong>Unix</strong> system that supports the <strong>apt-get</strong> package manager, the easiest way to meet these requirements is to perform the following commands:

    $ apt-get install apache2 php5 mysql-server php5-dev php5-memcache memcached php5-curl php5-mcrypt
    $ a2enmod rewrite
    $ php5enmod mcrypt
    $ pecl install dbase
    $ php5enmod dbase
    $ service apache2 restart

If you're using a <strong>Linux</strong> distribution derived from the Red Hat family, or which uses the <strong>yum</strong> package manager, you may need to follow the [CentOS 6](installation_centos6) installation instructions.

If you're using a <strong>Windows</strong> system, you'll have to download a web stack that holds the necessary requirements, such as [WAMPServer](http://www.wampserver.com/en/), plus [msysgit](http://msysgit.github.io/).

If you're using a <strong>Mac</strong> system, you'll have to download a web stack which contains the necessary requirements, such as [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html).

Set the rewrite rules in <code>/etc/apache2/sites-available/default</code> to <code>ALL</code>:

    <VirtualHost *:80>
            ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
            ServerName tdt.dev
            DocumentRoot /var/www/core/public
            <Directory /var/www/core/public>
                    Require all granted
                    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
                    AllowOverride All
                    Order allow,deny
                    allow from all
            </Directory>

            ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log

            # Possible values include: debug, info, notice, warn, error, crit,
            # alert, emerg.
            LogLevel warn

            CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined

    </VirtualHost>


>> CAVEAT: When using Shared hosting, you might run into the issue that authentication headers are not set!! Do the following if you experience issues.

When using Shared Hosting, some PHP Authentication headers might not be in use, this is essential though, as we use them in our application. Therefore, to resolve this, add the following to your .htaccess

    RewriteEngine on
    RewriteRule .* - [E=HTTP_AUTHORIZATION:%{HTTP:Authorization}]

## Installation

### Preparations

An installation through the command line requires the installation of [composer](http://getcomposer.org/). Make sure you have it installed properly and ready to use. Next to that, you'll need to prepare a database with a user that has read & write permissions for The DataTank to use.


#### Clone the project

To install the project on your device, open up a terminal and clone our repository

    git clone https://github.com/tdt/core.git


#### Configure the database

Provide your database credentials in the `app/config/database.php` file, according to the [Laravel database configuration](http://laravel.com/docs/4.0/configuration).

After that you're ready to make composer work his magic! Run the following commands from the root of the folder where you cloned the repository:


    $ composer install
    $ composer update

#### Add permissions to the log directory

To store logs and other files, the right permissions need to be set:

    $ chmod -R  777 /var/www/tdt/app/storage/

#### Get started with our demo data

In order to get you started, we've provided a seeder that publishes a set of data files. This can be done with the following command:

    php artisan db:seed --class=DemoDataSeeder

This will publish some data sets to some self-explanatory uri's. For example CSV files will be published under the collection uri 'csv', JSON files under 'json', and so on and so forth.

#### Get started with our user interface

We've created a user interface to manage datasets and users on the uri api/admin, relative to the root uri.  The default credentials for the admin user are:

    user: admin
    password: admin

If no users were automatically created during the install you can create an initial admin user with the following command:

    php artisan db:seed --class=UserSeeder


Best practice is to change the admin password immediately by editing it using the user interface. Click the question mark <i class='fa fa-lg fa-question-circle'></i> in the user interface to start the help guide.
